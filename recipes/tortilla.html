    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tortilla española is a potato and onion omelet.
        <br>It's a classic tapas dish, prepared all over Spain. 
        <br>This version also includes roasted red peppers and Spanish Serrano ham.
        <br>Unlike most omelets, a Spanish tortilla is served at room temperature.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>

        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>

             <p> Heat 1/2 cup olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. 
            <br>Add 1/2 of the potato slices, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
            <br> Transfer potatoes to a large bowl, leaving oil in the skillet. 
            <br>Add remaining potatoes to the skillet; cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 15 to 20 minutes. 
            <br>Transfer potatoes to the bowl, reserving oil in the skillet. Season potatoes with salt and pepper.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>

            <p> Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat.
            <br>Stir in onion rings, and gently cook until soft and golden brown, about 15 minutes. 
            <br>Spoon onions onto a plate, and allow to cool.</p>

        <li><Strong>Step 3</Strong></li>

            <p>Whisk eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in cooled onions, roasted peppers, and serrano ham.
            <br>Gently fold in cooked potatoes.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>

            <p>Heat the large skillet with reserved oil over low heat. 
            <br>Pour in egg mixture, and gently cook until the sides have started to set and the bottom has turned golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            <br>Loosen tortilla with a spatula if needed, then carefully slide onto a large plate. 
            <br>Turn the skillet upside down and place onto the uncooked side of tortilla. 
            <br>Turn the skillet right-side-up, and remove the plate. 
            <br>Return the skillet to the stove, and continue cooking until tortilla has set in the center, about 4 minutes.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>

            <p> Slide the tortilla onto a serving plate and allow to cool to room temperature. 
            <br>Cut into six wedges and sprinkle with parsley to serve.</p>
